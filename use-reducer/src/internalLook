function useReducer(reducer, initialState) {
  let state = initialState;  // Set the initial state

  function dispatch(action) {
    // When dispatch is called, it triggers the reducer
    state = reducer(state, action);  // Update the state based on the action
  }

  return [state, dispatch];  // Return state and dispatch to the component
